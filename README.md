# melange-examples

A repository of demo projects using
[Melange](https://github.com/melange-re/melange) and
[opam](https://opam.ocaml.org/).

If you are looking for a template with esy, check
[melange-esy-template](https://github.com/melange-re/melange-esy-template).

## Examples

Each example is a self-contained, complete project with its README, a Makefile
and an opam file to define the dependencies.

To use any of the examples, you can copy/paste the example folder in a new
project and start hacking on it.

Each example includes a `README.md` with instructions on how to get started.

- [**`1-node`**](examples/1-node) &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp; a simple Node.js
  application, prints a "hello world" message when it runs.
- [**`2-react`**](examples/2-react) &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp; a simple Reason React
  app with Webpack.
